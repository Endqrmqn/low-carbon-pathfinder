                    <p>A coalition of industry associations and 22 state attorneys general (AG), led by West Virginia AG JB McCuskey, filed a lawsuit against the State of New York in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York challenging the validity of the state’s recently enacted Climate Change Superfund Act. The complaint asserts that the act’s retroactive imposition of multibillion-dollar fines on fossil fuel companies is both preempted by federal law and violates several bedrock constitutional principles.</p>

The Members’ legislation requires the largest U.S.-based fossil fuel extractors and oil refiners and foreign-owned companies doing business in the U.S. to pay into a $1 trillion Polluters Pay Climate Fund, with their contributions based on a percentage of their global emissions. The Fund would then be used to finance a wide range of efforts to tackle the impacts of climate change.</p>

Of those who have faced these and other types of extreme weather or natural disaster events, 72% consider climate change to be a contributing factor. 

                        Relatively few feel that climate change has already had a major impact in their lives, but many think it will impact them in the future. Less than half think that climate change will not have impact them personally, their health, or air quality or availability of water in their area at some point in their lifetime.</p>

                    <p>LONDON, Feb 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Natural disasters are becoming more frequent, deadly and damaging. At the same time, insurers are pulling coverage from areas most vulnerable to wildfires, floods, droughts and hurricanes. Their efforts to dodge the costs will be in vain, however. Governments won’t tolerate permanent insurance dead zones and can’t afford to pay up themselves. That means property and casualty firms like AIG (AIG.N), opens new tab, AXA (AXAF.PA), opens new tab and Chubb (CB.BN), opens new tab will have to end up footing much of the bill one way or another.</p>

                        China’s digital economy is currently thriving, with the “dual carbon” targets representing a significant pursuit of economic development. The role of the digital economy in achieving these targets warrants detailed discussion. Using urban panel data from China spanning 2011 to 2021, this paper empirically examines the impact of the digital economy on urban carbon emissions. The findings reveal several key points: Firstly, the digital economy significantly reduces urban carbon emissions and enh</p>
